# QuantifyingStyle
By Will Bates\
16 March 2020\
Based on studies by Jason Bailey and Lev Manovich\

Can we prove or disprove the artistic judgement of a human viewer numerically, and if so, what are the implications on the world of art? How will classification of artistic genres, movements, and eras change when granted a more rigid, quantitative definition? And if we can't conclusively classify artistic style, what attribute are humans given to work with that the model isn't?
